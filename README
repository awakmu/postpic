	PostPic: A PostgreSQL extension for image-processing
	====================================================

PostPic is an extension for the open source PostgreSQL dbms that enables
image processing inside the database, like PostGIS does for spatial data.
It adds the new 'image' type to the SQL, and several functions to process
mages and to extract their attributes.

Eg.
	select the_image as i from my_images where date(i) > '2009-01-01'::date
		and width(i) > 1600;

Traditional relational clauses can be combined in queries with image-related
ones, and basic image processing can be performed in SQL.
