Compiling the sources
---------------------

Typing 'make' at the command prompt builds the server extension and the
utils. You can build the jdbc add-on with 'make jdbc' or everything with
'make all'. See the top-level Makefile for other targets.

PostPic uses pgxs for extension building, so you can try to install the
extension with 'sudo make -C server install'.
The install target copies the dynamic library in the server's library
directory and the postpic.sql in the data dir.
You need to run this script in a database in order to enable image
processing.


Dependencies
------------

PostPic depends on the PostgreSQL server (obviously) and on the
GraphicsMagick library. If you install them via your operating system's
package manager, be sure to install the development packages too.

Eg.
	sudo apt-get libgraphicsmagick-dev postgresql-server-dev-8.4

Before compiling PostPic, the following programs should be in your path:
 * GraphicsMagick-config
 * pg_config
